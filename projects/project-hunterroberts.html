                <div class="project-normal">
                    In late 2012/early 2013, Cell Podium conducted a study for NIOSH to evaluate the feasibility cell phone multimedia as a mechanism to disseminate occupational safety refresher training for construction safety. Cell Podium collaborated with the Hunter Roberts
                    Construction Group. Hunter Roberts maintains an “Incident & Injury-Free” (IIF) safety initiative, which strives to eliminate danger at construction work sites through a highly personal approach that shifts focus away from a compliance
                    requirement to a concern for workers’ health and welfare.
                    <br /><br /> The Cell Podium – Hunter Roberts collaboration consisted of deploying a mobile multimedia campaign on occupational safety at a Hunter Roberts construction site.

                <div class="blog-title project-title">Project Execution</div>
                <div class="project-normal">
                    Hunter Roberts selected for the mobile campaign thirteen topics aligned with its IFF training material: electrical safety, fall protection, forklift safety, hoisting safety, reporting injuries, keeping clean, ladder safety, material safety, personal protective
                    equipment, scaffolding safety, stairway safety, utility safety, and solicitation for comments.
                    <br /><br /> A campaign was designed with thirteen 60-second videos, one on each of the aforementioned topics. CellPodium configured three campaigns in the CMS, each with the same broadcast dates (approximately two videos per week),
                    but differing in the broadcast time and enrollment keyword. Upon receiving one of these keywords, the CMS would assign the sender’s caller-ID to the campaign with the associated broadcast time. Similarly, upon receiving the keyword
                    “stop”, “end”, or “quit”, the CMS would remove the sender from all broadcasts.

                <div class="blog-title project-title">Project Impact</div>
                <div class="project-normal">
                    Analysis of the 2012 Pew Health Tracking survey dataset (Pew 2012) reveals that (1) fewer than half the households with income under $20,000/year have access to the internet, and (2) the majority of adults without access to the internet own traditional
                    cell phones, i.e., feature phones and not the more expensive smartphone models. This analysis confirms that cell phone adoption exceeds Internet adoption particularly among vulnerable populations, and quantifies the significance of
                    delivering public health multimedia to the feature phones of this demographic without access to the Internet. For almost one third of households making under $20,000/year, or one quarter of households making under $40,000/year, this
                    may be the only option to deliver public health multimedia.
                    <br /><br /> Construction worker salaries in New Jersey average $46,670/year (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2013), implying that roughly 60% of cell phones owned by construction workers do not have Internet access and can only receive
                    video broadcasts in the form of interoperable MMS. The CMS thus enables just-in-time access to a significant population that is disconnected from the mobile Internet.
