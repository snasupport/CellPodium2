        <h4>U.S. Public Health Service Rapid Deployment Force</h4><br /> In November 2012, during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the U.S. Public Health Service Rapid Deployment Force-3 (RDF-3) arrived in New Jersey to establish Federal Medical Stations
        for patients who could not access needed services at regular shelters. USPHS Captain Ralph O’Conner, also Emergency Management Specialist at the CDC/OPHPR Division of Emergency Operations, was part of this deployment. Power outages interrupted
        most cell phone towers, hampering wireless broadband and even voice calls on cell phones. Moreover, wind damage took out conventional wired Internet. However, SMS and MMS, which require less power and bandwidth than wireless voice or broadband,
        were reliable (Figure 1).

        <br /><br /> Captain O’Conner reached out to Cell Podium to use the CMS to broadcast logistics videos with mobilization instructions to the cell phones of RDF-3 personnel, and help coordinate response operations. A mobile multimedia campaign was
        developed that provided demobilization tips for the RDF-3 team stationed in Fort Dix, New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy (Figure 2). The campaign was launched November 14th 2012 and accumulated 34 enrollments. The campaign timeline was as follows:
